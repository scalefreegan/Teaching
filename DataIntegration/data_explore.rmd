Basic exploration of data sent by Jean-Karim for Data Integration course at EMBL Dec 2015

Data available at: https://oc.embl.de/index.php/s/qiOSCyvYRdxraRw

I wrote a custom script to process these data:

```{r}
devtools::source_url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scalefreegan/Teaching/master/DataIntegration/readData.R")
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
