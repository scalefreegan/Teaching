[Companion lecture](http://scalefreegan.github.io/Teaching/DataIntegration/lectures/l2.html)

At the end of the previous session, we processed Jean-Karim's graph kernels, combining them into a single graph. In this session, we will apply two clustering techniques to the integrated data: spectral clustering and link-community clustering.

# Spirals: Spectral Clustering

As you will recall from the lecture, spectral clustering is a technique for clustering based on transformation by dimensionality reduction.

Before applying spectral clustering to our data, we will derive a simple algorithm for spectral clustering. This will allow us to see more clearly how spectral clustering relates to k-means. We will once again explore the `spirals` data used during the first tutorial.

The algorithm we will generate is similar to that described by Ng et al. [On Spectral Clustering: Analysis and an algorithm](http://ai.stanford.edu/~ang/papers/nips01-spectral.pdf). The `R` code was obtained and adapted from [João Neto](http://www.di.fc.ul.pt/~jpn/r/spectralclustering/spectralclustering.html)

If it is not already loaded, please load the spirals dataset, which is included in the `kernlab` package.

```{r}
library(kernlab)
data(spirals)
```

To remind you, spectral clustering appeared to provide a more desired result when clustering data sets that are separated poorly by standard k-means. Below I plot the data and the clustering result for both algorithms.

```{r fig.align="center", echo=FALSE, fig.height=2.5}
  par(mfrow = c(1,3))
    km <- kmeans(spirals, centers = 2)
    sc <- specc(spirals, centers = 2)
    plot(spirals, pch = 19, xlab = "", ylab = "")
    plot(spirals, col = km$cluster, pch = 19, xlab = "", ylab = "", main="K-means")
    points(km$centers, col=1:2, pch=8, cex=2)
    plot(spirals, col = sc, pch = 19, xlab = "", ylab = "", main="Spectral clustering")
```

In what follows, we will write an algorithm to perform spectral clustering. We will see - perhaps surprisingly - that spectral clustering boils down to performing k-means on eigenvectors of a similarity kernel applied to the original data.

To help you write your code, [João Neto](http://www.di.fc.ul.pt/~jpn/r/spectralclustering/spectralclustering.html) has provided several pre-rolled functions, including:

- A Gaussian kernel, **s**, to **calculate the similarity** between two points.

```{r }
s <- function(x1, x2, alpha=1) {
  exp(- alpha * norm(as.matrix(x1-x2), type="F"))
}
```

- A function, **make.affinity** to compute a restricted (or filtered) "affinity" between vertices using k-nearest neighbors.

```{r }
make.affinity <- function(S, n.neighboors=2) {
  N <- length(S[,1])

  if (n.neighboors >= N) {  # fully connected
    A <- S
  } else {
    A <- matrix(rep(0,N^2), ncol=N)
    for(i in 1:N) { # for each line
      # only connect to those points with larger similarity
      best.similarities <- sort(S[i,], decreasing=TRUE)[1:n.neighboors]
      for (s in best.similarities) {
        j <- which(S[i,] == s)
        A[i,j] <- S[i,j]
        A[j,i] <- S[i,j] # to make an undirected graph, ie, the matrix becomes symmetric
      }
    }
  }
  A
}
```

Your algorithm should include the following steps:

1. Compute the similarity matrix, **S**, between all points in the `spiral` dataset
2. Calculate the affinity matrix, **A**, from **S** by applying k-nearest neighbors algorithm
3. Compute the weighted degree diagonal matrix, **D**, from **A** by summing across each row
4. Calculate the unnormalized Laplacian, **U**, by subtracting **A** from **D**
5. Compute eigenvectors and eigenvalues of **U**.
6. Perform k-means clustering on k smallest eigenvalues, ignoring the smallest (constant) eigenvector

We will perform these steps one at a time. *If you find yourself spending more than 10-15 minutes on this section, please read the solution and move on to the following activities.*

# Link-community detection

Link-community detection inverts the clustering problem. Rather than cluster similar nodes, it instead clusters similar edges.

In link-community detection, nodes can now belong to several clusters. This is particularly useful in biological contexts, where one might like to express, for example, the different role a particular gene has in different contexts.

You can learn more about link-community detection in the [original paper](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v466/n7307/full/nature09182.html)
